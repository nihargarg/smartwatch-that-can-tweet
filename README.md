# Smartwatch that can Tweet!

### Programmed an embedded system to create a smartwatch in the Internet of Things class at Columbia University.

### Key skills learned:
* Reading and Procesing Sensor Data: Adjust LCD screen brightness based on ambient light readings converted using an ADC, and debounce (interrupt only once) buttons that allow user to change the current time and alarm time
* I2C Bus Comunication: Display data on LCD screen
* SPI Bus Comunication: Implement text scrolling based on accelerometer readings
* Interfacing with the World: Connect to Wi-Fi, obtain and modify system time by synchronizing to server, interface with a Geolocation API, feed cordinates into a Weather API to receive weather data, and post tweet using twitter API
